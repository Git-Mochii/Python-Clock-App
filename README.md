# Python-Clock-App

This is a clock application I made in Python using the 'tkinter' import.

The application displays the current year, month, and day on the left side of the display. On the right side of the display the current hour, minute and second. 
On the top side of the application, the year/month/day and hour/minute/second are put together into a small box. The application has a fixed pixel resolution to avoid any display bugs.

The application's purpose is quite simple; to display the current year/month/day and hour/minute/second to a user. The application's code is also simple; containing labels and the main function in a class.

The main function (time_update) operates by updating the labels every second to match the local time of the user. 

(The only reason I didn't name this app as "Simple Clock App" is because I aimed to make it with simplicity and a small but varied range of information for it to display.)
